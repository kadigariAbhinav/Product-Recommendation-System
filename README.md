# Product-Recommendation-System
This project proposes a Product Recommendation System using clustering algorithms to group users and products based on behaviors and preferences, improving the relevance of product suggestions. Algorithms like K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN, and K-Nearest Neighbours (kNN) are used to refine recommendations.
